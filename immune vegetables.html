<div style=color:blue> bell peppers:</div>
Not only are bell peppers a good source of fiber and antioxidants,
they’re extremely high in vitamin C.
One cup of chopped bell peppers provides 190 mg,
which is more than three times the recommended daily intake.
Vitamin C, Hogan says, is known for its immune benefits like supporting cellular function in both the innate and adaptive immune systems.
Eat it: Dice a bell pepper (of any color!) and stir fry with chicken, rice, and other vegetables like broccoli.
Or cut into spears and dip into your favorite yogurt-based sauce or hummus for a boost of protein and calcium.

<div style=color:blue> garlic:</div>
Considered a vegetable, Hogan says, garlic is a potent antioxidant thanks to its allicin content.
Just one clove is enough to help fortify your immune system—and you don’t have to eat it raw, either.
“Garlic doesn’t lose its immune benefits when cooked,” she says.
Garlic is a tasty addition to meals,
but did you know it's also beneficial for your immune system? There's lots of research
to back up the claim that garlic is full of antioxidants which help to fight infection and support the immune system.
It has been found that garlic has high concentrations of vitamin C and B6, and it also contains a compound called allicin.
This compound is released when you cut or crush a clove of garlic.
Allicin is what gives garlic a distinctive smell and is thought to be part of the reason for its immune-boosting properties.
That's why it is important to crush or chop your garlic before using it.
Raw garlic is most beneficial for health; but it is thought that by leaving crushed or chopped garlic to stand before heating,
it could help retain its health-giving properties
Eat it: Sauté and add to your favorite sauce or salad dressing recipe.

<div style=color:blue>asparagus:</div>
Hogan includes asparagus on this list because of its inulin content,
which is a prebiotic. Asparagus also provides potassium, and while not an immune-system booster,
it is essential for muscle health. A serving of asparagus is about six medium spears.
Eat it: Grill up the spears with a little oil, salt, and pepper and serve with your favorite barbecued foods.
Asparagus also goes great on top of a green salad with a drizzle of lemon juice.

<div style=color:blue>dark leafy greens:</div>
Take your pick: spinach, kale, Swiss chard, to name a few. 
Leafy greens are a powerhouse of antioxidants, and vitamins C and E. 
Fat-soluble vitamin E is one of the more potent antioxidants. 
Researchers are studying whether it can help prevent or delay chronic diseases associated with free radicals that cause damage to cells, 
according to the National Institutes of Health.
Eat it: Toss in a salad for a traditional route, or sauté and mix into a veggie omelet or stir-fry. 
Another idea: Bake kale chips with a drizzle of oil, lemon juice, salt, pepper, 
and cayenne for a nutritious, crunchy snack.</li>

<div style=color:blue>broccoli:</div>
You didn’t think we’d miss the crown jewel of veggies, 
did you? Broccoli is a rich source of antioxidants and vitamin C, 
Hogan says. It also provides potassium, iron, and calcium. 
A serving is a half-cup and when prepared just right, you may even go for a full cup.
Eat it: Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, 
and roast in the oven for about 15 minutes at 400 degrees. 
You’ll get perfectly crisp (but not burnt) poppable broccoli bites that are healthy and delicious..</li>
