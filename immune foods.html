Leafy greens like spinach, kale, and cabbage are rich in Vitamin A,
which is important for immune function. Men need 900 micrograms of vitamin A every day,
while women need 700 micrograms. According to a 2018 study,
scientists know that vitamin A is important for the immune system,
but they don't understand exactly why. They believe that the vitamin affects bone marrow production,
as the bone marrow produces immune cells such as lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell that can help fight infection.
A 2019 study published in Nutrition Reviews found that leafy greens are also rich in dietary nitrates,
an organic compound with anti-inflammatory properties that can help regulate the immune system.</li>

which can help maintain healthy bones and skin.
She pointed out that "healthy tissue is the first barrier against infection,
" when your skin is healthy, it prevents harmful bacteria or viruses,

"Green tea is very rich in antioxidants, polyphenols,
and antioxidants that help prevent cell damage.
Generally healthier cells will allow the body to have a better immune response,
" says Sofront. A 2016 study published in 2016 found that the antioxidants in green tea can improve the response.

Sofront explains that the immune benefits of turmeric are linked to curcumin,
an ingredient that gives it its dark yellow color.
“It appears that curcumin has the ability to modulate the immune system by
activating some immune-related cells and inhibiting the effect of certain pro-inflammatory compounds,” said Sofronte.</li>
